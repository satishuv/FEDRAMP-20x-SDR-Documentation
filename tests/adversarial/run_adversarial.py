"""Adversarial test suite: prove the framework's gates DETECT deliberate
manipulation. Each test tampers with one thing and asserts the relevant gate
catches it. Offline, no network, no AWS.

These are the highest-value tests in the repo: they prove the validators
survive hostile edits, not just that the happy path builds. Run:
    python tests/adversarial/run_adversarial.py

Design: tests call the real gate logic (imported), not a reimplementation, so a
test passing means the actual shipped gate catches the attack.
