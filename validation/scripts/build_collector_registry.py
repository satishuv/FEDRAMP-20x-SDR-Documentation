# Build the collector registry: a machine-readable map from each Key
# Security Indicator (KSI) to concrete read-only AWS checks, derived from
# traceability/aws-service-ksi-map.json.
#
# Layer 1 of the automation design: deterministic collectors only. Each
# check is one of:
#   config_managed_rule  - an AWS Config managed rule named in the guidance
#                          (backtick-quoted); collectable today via
#                          config:DescribeComplianceByConfigRule.
#   described_method     - a verify or validate method described in prose;
#                          carried for traceability until a dedicated
#                          collector implements it.
# Pipeline position: run after build_notes.py (needs the service map).
# Deterministic: output is pinned to the dataset version, no run timestamps.

# Explicit posture-metric source allowlist: collector service-key -> the KSIs

# routing for KMT metric history, derived from the collector-to-KSI mapping the
# collectors' own docstrings declare ("Maps: ...") and the bucket_a signals in
# pending-ksi-classification.json - NOT from prose service-name matching.
#
# Why this exists (finding: generic service -> KSI metric fan-out): routing a
# posture service to every KSI whose prose happens to name it let unrelated
# posture (e.g. generic S3/Config/IAM) manufacture daily metric history for a
# KSI it says nothing about (e.g. KSI-CED-RAT employee training). A service now
# contributes a metric to a KSI ONLY if that KSI id appears here. A KSI whose
# assurance is document/process evidence (bucket_b) has NO posture source and
# therefore accrues no automated metric history from generic posture.
#
# Service keys MUST match automation/collectors/service_registry.py exactly.
#
# AUD-F16: every key is CHECK-SCOPED ("service:check"). A bare service key
# routed every fact of that service, so a good-looking unrelated check lifted a
# KSI: Access Analyzer PRESENT (1/1) improved KSI-IAM-ELP while the analyzer's
# active findings (the actual least-privilege signal) were open; generic S3
# encryption fed data-removal; generic Backup plans fed recovery TESTING; a
# CloudTrail SIEM-capture count fed resource INTEGRITY. The check names are the
# collectors' `_fact(service, check, ...)` names; method_ids.assert_check_scoped
# refuses a registry with any bare key, and test_collector_registry_routes
# asserts every route names a check a collector actually emits.
