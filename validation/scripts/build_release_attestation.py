"""Emit artifacts/release-attestation.json: a release-time envelope that binds
the DETERMINISTIC release manifest to the exact git source that produced it,
WITHOUT mutating the manifest.

Why a separate file rather than stamping the manifest:
  - The human package signoff (checked by package-preflight) is bound to the
    SHA-256 of release-manifest.json's bytes. If a release step added git
    commit/tree INTO that manifest, its hash would change and the prior signoff
    would silently go stale.
  - The commit hash also cannot be known before the commit that contains the
    manifest (circular), and mutating the manifest breaks the CI
    regenerate-and-diff gate.

So the ordering is: build -> validate -> reproducibility -> human signoff (binds
the deterministic manifest) -> package-preflight (verifies that binding) ->
THIS attestation (binds that same manifest hash to the git commit/tree) -> tag.
The attestation references the manifest by hash; it never changes it.

Fail-closed provenance: because `sdr.py release` builds from the WORKING TREE,
this script refuses to write an attestation when (a) git provenance is
unavailable, (b) the tracked working tree differs from HEAD, or (c) untracked
non-ignored files are present - any of which would make "this commit is the
source that produced the manifest" materially false. *.docx is excluded from
the tree comparison (its zip container embeds timestamps), matching every other
diff gate in the repo. The deployed CodePipeline is already protected because it
clones via CODEBUILD_CLONE_REF and runs a regenerate-and-diff gate; this closes
the equivalent hole in the local release path.

This file is NOT committed in ordinary builds (it names a specific commit and is
release-only); it is produced at release/publish time. Run:

    python validation/scripts/build_release_attestation.py
