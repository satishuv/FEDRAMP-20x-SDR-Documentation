# Adversarial tests for the Class A submitted-scope filter shared by the SDR
# builder (build_sdr.py) and package-preflight (sdr.py cmd_preflight).
#
# Defect locked here (found at e24308a): build_sdr.py excluded
# unselected FRC-CLA-OFR optional (MAY) rules from the submitted Class A SDR, but
# preflight computed its applicable-record set from the FULL 41-rule Class A
# profile. The readiness gate therefore evaluated a different rule set than the
# SDR it was gating - it would demand implementation records for the 9 optional
# rules the SDR does not include. The earlier submission-readiness test masked
# this because it filled records for all 41 profile rules before preflight.
#
# The fix routes BOTH consumers through sdr.submitted_rule_ids(); these tests
# assert that helper against the real Class A profile so builder and gate agree.
#
# Run: python validation/scripts/test_class_a_applicable_scope.py
