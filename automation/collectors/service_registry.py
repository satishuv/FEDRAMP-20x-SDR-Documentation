"""Canonical collector-service routing registry.

Single source of truth mapping every service name a production collector emits
(collectors.py _fact("<service>", ...)) to its human display name for downstream
routing (deterministic prefill, AI drafting context, provenance). Metric history
buckets by whatever service it sees and does not need a whitelist, but prefill/AI
DO look services up by name, so a service that collectors emit but this registry
omits would have its telemetry silently unrouted.

The invariant test (test_service_registry.py) asserts that every service the
collectors emit is either present here (routed) or explicitly listed as
telemetry-only, so this cannot drift out of sync again.

Service keys MUST match the collector's emitted names exactly (securityhub,
accessanalyzer, inspector2 - not security_hub / access_analyzer / inspector).
