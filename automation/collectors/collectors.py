# Read-only AWS posture collectors (Layer 1, broadened).
#
# Each function queries ONE AWS service with read-only describe/list/get calls
# and returns a list of dated posture facts. Facts are telemetry, never
# statuses: nothing here decides that a control is Implemented. A fact records
# what a read-only API returned at a point in time, for a human (or a gated
# pipeline step) to interpret.
#
# Read-only by construction. The complete set of API actions this module may
# call is enumerated in READ_ONLY_ACTIONS below; the collector driver asserts
# every call it makes is in that set, and refuses admin-looking identities.
# Adding a service means adding its read-only actions to that set on purpose,
# which is a reviewable change rather than a silent permission widening.
#
# Every collector is written to be offline-testable: it takes a boto3-style
# session whose clients can be stubbed, catches client errors, and never
# raises out of a single service failure (one unreachable service must not
# sink a whole collection run).

    a human-readable, non-sensitive summary. Never include ARNs of principals,
    account IDs, or finding bodies that could carry sensitive specifics.

    measured/total (optional) carry the STRUCTURED ratio behind an OBSERVED
    fact: `measured` resources met the desirable condition out of `total`
    evaluated. The metric engine uses these to compute a real passing fraction;
    a bare OBSERVED with no measured/total is an observation, NOT a pass (an
    observation that something was measured is not the same as the measured
    thing being in good posture). For a count where MORE is worse (e.g. failed
    findings, drifted stacks), set measured to the GOOD count (total - bad) so
    the fraction still reads as "fraction in good posture".

    Coverage (AUD-F15 / AUD-F17). `total` is what was EVALUATED. It is not the
    same as what is IN SCOPE: a per-resource read can be denied or throttled,
    and a listing can be cut short. So a ratio fact also carries
      scope_total     resources the collector enumerated (the denominator that
                      matters to an assessor),
      evaluated_total the same value as `total`, named for what it is,
      unknown_total   scope_total - evaluated_total: enumerated but NOT
