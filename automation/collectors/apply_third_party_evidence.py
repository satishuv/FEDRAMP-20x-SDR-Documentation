"""Apply enabled third-party evidence sources (CrowdStrike Falcon, Wiz) to the
record store, per the opt-in flags in the offering profile.

This is OPT-IN and does nothing unless a source is enabled in
profiles/common/offering-profile.json under evidence_sources. For each enabled
source it reads the customer-produced export file, runs the matching adapter,
and attaches the resulting evidence to that source's mapped KSIs in
sdr/records/records-store.json.

Trust boundary (unchanged): only the ksi `evidence` array is touched. No
implementation, validation, or assessment status is set. If a source is
enabled but its export file is absent, the source is skipped with a message,
not an error, so a fresh clone with the flag on but no export still builds.

    python automation/collectors/apply_third_party_evidence.py

Run before build_sdr.py so the attached evidence flows into the SDR. Offline:
reads only local files, no network, no credentials.
