"""Optional third-party evidence adapters: CrowdStrike Falcon and Wiz.

These are OPT-IN, per customer. One customer may run CrowdStrike, another Wiz,
another neither; nothing here is enabled by default. Each adapter turns a
security tool's EXPORT (a JSON file the customer produces in their own
environment) into SDR evidence entries via the shared EvidenceAdapter
interface, so the output lands as hashed, schema-valid ksiEvidence objects
under the exact same trust boundary as the AWS collectors:

  - Telemetry only. An adapter NEVER sets or changes an implementation,
    validation, or assessment status. A detection count or sensor-coverage
    figure is a metric, not a compliance verdict.
  - Offline and secret-free. Adapters read a file the customer already
    exported; this repository holds NO Falcon or Wiz API client and NO API
    credentials. Fetching from the live API (which needs a token) is the
    customer's own step in their own environment, kept out of this public
    template so the secret-scanners stay clean. See the reference note in each
    adapter for the expected export shape.

Each adapter maps to REAL CR26 KSI ids (verified against the pinned dataset),
returned by ksi_targets() so a caller knows which indicators the evidence
supports. The adapter attaches evidence; a human still decides the status.

Offline by construction: pure functions over the export dict. Run the tests:
