"""Collector IAM parity test.

The scheduled collector pipeline (automation/pipeline/sdr-pipeline.yaml) deploys
a CollectorRole. That role's granted actions MUST be a superset of the actions
the collectors actually call (automation/collectors/collectors.py
READ_ONLY_ACTIONS); otherwise a deployed collector produces AccessDenied for
everything the grant omits. This test fails if the collector adds an API call
that the deployed role does not grant.
